        each with their own attack, "super" and "star powers". you charge up your super by attacking others and 
        you unlock brawlers and star powers from "brawl boxes". Star powers give extra abilities when playing.
        Brawl boxes are this games version of loot chests. After choosing a brawler and possibly a star power 
        you choose a mode to brawl in. There are many modes including bounty, heist, and showdown. In most of 
        the modes you fight in a small 3v3 arena, but in some modes you fight with 9 other brawlers in a big arena.
